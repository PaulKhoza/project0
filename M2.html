              The BMW M2 is the successor to the 1M Coupe – a nuggety, short-wheelbase hooligan of a machine. 
              The 1M was great fun but, never got the full M title it deserved because BMW regards the M1 nameplate (which featured on the supercar the Munich-based manufacturer built in the late '70s) as sacrosanct. 
              Now that the 1 Series Coupe is called a 2 Series, BMW has no problem sticking a full M2 logo on the back of it's flagship model. 
              The BMW M2 was launched at the Franschhoek Motor Museum in Cape Town.

            The M2 is essentially an M235i with plenty of M go-faster bits. The bits mostly come from the M3 and include a special M differential, M axles and M steering system. 
            It wouldn’t be special if it didn’t have more power, so the engineers have upped the power to 272 kW with up to 500 Nm of torque when the overboost kicks in. 
            The way the engineers explained it, the M2 is an M235i but with a little bit extra and it has the capability to spend long periods on track and remain reliable under high-stress usage. 
            The BMW M2 takes only 4.3 seconds to crack 100 kph from standstill before reaching its limited top speed of 250 kph, which can be increased to 270 kph with the M Drivers Package option box.

            BMW has cleverly integrated a GoPro application within its Connected Drive infotainment system. 
            The app connects seamlessly with a GoPro dash-mounted camera and then records fast laps with the ability to plug in data from the vehicle. 
            Things like steering angle, braking, acceleration and speed can be measured and analysed later to improve and hone skills on the track, a nice addition for track enthusiasts.

            As you’d imagine from a pure BMW M car, the interior is awash with sporty touches. 
            The thick-rimmed M steering wheel has blue stitching and there’s a unique M gear lever too. 
            The gear lever is either connected to a six-speed manual gearbox or a seven-speed dual clutch gearbox.
             To spruce up the rest of the cabin, BMW applied several carbon fibre trims and Alcantara in the doors.
             It feels very much like an M car inside, but without the heavier price tag that other M models carry.
