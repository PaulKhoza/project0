                Since Mercedes-AMG introduced the world’s most powerful 2.0-litre turbo production engine (yes, that was the Stuttgart-based brand’s official claim) in the A45, 
                the rest of the segment has been scrambling to find an answer to the belligerent baby Benz. Audi’s riposte is this model and with it,
                Ingolstadt politely flips the bird at any notion of using a 2.0-litre; it utilises an extra cylinder and is half a litre bigger.
                Yes, the iconic five-cylinder turbo motor has been retained and what a marvel it is.

            <p class="story">
                Courtesy of 270kW and 465Nm produced by a single-turbo 2.5-litre five cylinder motor, Audi’s RS3 is deceptively rapid and has a provocative soundtrack. 
                It has purposeful start-up and idle notes and, once on the move, it delivers delicious rapid artillery-like exhaust backfires, 
                while upshifts are punctuated by staccato barks accompanied by pops and whistles from the turbocharger. It’s nothing short of an aural feast.  The downside is thirsty fuel consumption. 
                Drive hard and you’ll see figures north of 14L/100km, but if you’re like us and drive mostly in Comfort, under 13L/100km is possible

                It’s not just about herculean straight-line efforts however. Audi has a sterling reputation for producing fine-handling cars and the sure-footed RS3 is no exception. 
                The manufacturer claims it has reworked the newcomer’s quattro setup to deliver up to 100% of power to each axle. 
                The handling of a Quattro-equipped vehicle tends to exhibit understeer at the (albeit lofty) grip limit, 
                but the RS3 instils confidence in its driver when they’re pressing on. It is a pity, however,
                that the pleasingly sharp and direct steering system does not offer much in the way of feedback or weight through the driver’s palms.

                That should not detract from the fact that the Audi is ridiculously easy to drive fast. The shift programme of the 7-speed DSG transmission is particularly well matched with the performance characteristics of the engine.
                Audi’s Drive Select allows users to adjust the shift/throttle/suspension settings of the car to their tastes and whereas the transmission is quick to gear down —
                and accelerator responses are razor sharp — in Dynamic mode, the RS3 effortlessly produces bursts of speed in Auto, yet remains composed as soon as its pilot adopts a more relaxed driving style.    

                Meanwhile, the Audi’s ride quality is generally firm. You’d be wise to specify Magnetic Ride, which is a R13 460 option and would add a measure of extra on-road comfort, 
                but while riding on 19-inch alloy wheels wrapped in low-profile rubber, the RS3’s ride will always be classified as firm.

                s is the case with most Audis, the interior’s very smart and comfortable. That said, we drove the RS3 and an S3 back to back and 
                it’s remarkable how similar the cars’ interiors are, despite the price difference of around R150 000. You’d expect the flagship Audi A3 to feature a distinctive interior,
                but the cabin’s appearance is largely derivative. That typical flat-bottomed RS steering wheel, which incorporates controls for the infotainment system and cruise control
                and comes equipped with gearshift paddles that fall nicely to hand, is very functional, but it lacks a sense of visual drama. 

                Still, the interior’s build quality and specification are of a high standard. A particularly notable feature is Audi’s MMI screen, which stylishly slides up and down out of the dashboard.
