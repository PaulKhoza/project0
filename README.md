Homepage.html is the home page which has links to all the other html pages

Form.html is a form which would be used to subscribe to the website for updates

M2.html, G63.html and RS3.html are pages with articles which are originally from a website called cars.co.za, I put the link to the original articles at the end of each page for reference.

Styling.css and style.css have the style definitions for all the pages, style.css is compiled from style.scss which I included with the files.

I included the bootstrap stylesheet link from the bootstrap website and have one from my files as I worked mostly offline.
