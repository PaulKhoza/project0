                Mercedes-Benz unveiled the Gelandewagen as it was called backed then ,more than 40 years ago . 
                Built to be extremely tough, capable off-road and fit for a wide range of purposes,
                the G has evolved into an automotive icon – indestructible, anti-conformist,    even gangsta? 
                To its credit, Mercedes-Benz has remained largely true to the spirit of the original in terms of engineering – the G-Class may now be a fancy,
                blingy SUV, but at its core, it's still capable of driving down mountains. 
                Nevertheless, the full-fat AMG G63 is by far and away the most popular G-Class derivative... 
                It's a vehicle for people that like to be seen (and heard) and who are decidedly unlikely to ever engage its 3 diff locks. So, is the new G63 Edition 1 just an attention-grabber, 
                or does it actually compete with other luxury SUVs on refinement, luxury etc. too? Does it even matter?
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                Much like that other enduring German icon, the Porsche 911, the Mercedes-Benz G-Class' primary appeal is its appearance and the impression it instils in onlookers. 
                Mercedes-Benz was definitely aware of that and tasked its designers to keep the G's visual identity, even when logic dictates they shouldn't have. 
                Overall, the new G-Class is wider, longer and higher than before, but it retains its predecessors' signature elements – note the indicators sitting proud on the front fenders, 
                the near vertical (but slightly more tilted) front windscreen, the exposed door hinges and rear barn door. 
                Crikey, they've even ensured the solid doors are as hard to shut at first attempt as its predecessor's – that's attention to detail! 

                There's a very robust, metallic feel and sound to working the door handles and doors of the G63. They create an impression of incredible solidity, 
                but some passengers may struggle to close the doors properly – they do require a hefty thud. 
                Hoist yourself up into the driver's seat and it's quite clear that while Mercedes-Benz stuck to the retro rulebook outside, the same didn't apply inside.
                Here everything is high-tech and the finishes and trim also help to create a very modern ambience. 
                The cabin and its various fixtures feel as solid as you'd hope given the price range.
            </p>
            <p class="story">
                The G63 is powered by Mercedes-AMG's well-known 4.0-litre twin-turbo engine which, in this application, delivers a stonking 430 kW (at 6 000 rpm) and 850 Nm of torque from 2 500 to 3 500 rpm.
                It is mated with the marque's 9-speed automatic transmission that duly impressed with its immediacy and slickness during the G63 Edition 1's tenure in our test fleet. 
                At this point, it's worth noting the G63's kerb weight (around 2.5 tonnes) and the fact that it retains the brick-like aerodynamics (at face-value, anyway) of its predecessor. 
                It's worth pointing these facts out because they provide such great context for the figure that follows – the G63's ability to blast to from standstill to 100 kph in only 4.5 seconds!

                It's a unique experience – you're perched in a high-and-mighty seating position and, when you plant the throttle pedal, the G63 squats before catapulting down the road, accompanied by the most delicious roar
                (remember to make sure that the appropriate exhaust mode has been selected). 
                Childish? Yeah, quite possibly, but if you've got this much to spend on a vehicle, surely you'd want it to "move you"? Top speed is rated at 220 kph.
